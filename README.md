I'm an **entrepreneur** and hobby developer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating products to elevate people, and bringing the whole world to the next level. Some technologies I was selected to be an <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/">Arctic Code Vault Contributor 🌟</a> in 2020 based on my public Open Source contributions to popular projects since 2013 on GitHub such as [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Go](https://golang.org), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Python](https://www.python.org). I have also contributed code to [NASA's Mars 2020 Helicopter Mission](https://github.com/readme/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter). :rocket:
